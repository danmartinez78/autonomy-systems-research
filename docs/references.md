## Glossary

### A

**Autonomy**: The capability of a system to make decisions and take actions without human intervention.

### B

**Behavior Tree**: A hierarchical model of decision-making used in robotics and game AI.

### C

**Control Loop**: A feedback mechanism that monitors system output and adjusts inputs to maintain desired behavior.

### M

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and systems via JSON-RPC, enabling natural language control of software and hardware.

### V

**Visual Servoing**: A control technique that uses visual feedback (typically from cameras) to guide robot motion in real-time.
