# Initial Setup

Set up the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site with directory structure for reading notes, syntheses, knowledge base, and journal. Created templates for each artifact type. Established CC BY 4.0 (docs) / MIT (code) licensing.

**Decisions**: Organize by type (not topic), minimalist theme, public research artifacts.

Next: Begin populating with actual research content.
