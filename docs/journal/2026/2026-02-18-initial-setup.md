# Journal Entry: Week of February 18, 2026

## Overview

This week focused on establishing the knowledge base infrastructure for our autonomy systems research. Set up the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site and defined the information architecture for organizing research artifacts.

---

## What Changed

### Research Direction
- Established public knowledge base to facilitate collaborative research
- Defined structure for organizing reading notes, syntheses, and evergreen knowledge
- Committed to transparent, open research practices with public artifacts

### Understanding
- Reviewed best practices for research note-taking and knowledge management
- Evaluated Jekyll themes and decided on minimalist approach for clarity
- Identified key research areas: perception, planning, control, learning, system architecture

### Implementation
- Created directory structure under /docs
- Set up Jekyll configuration with GitHub Pages compatibility
- Developed content templates for different artifact types
- Created initial example content to demonstrate structure

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Decision**: Use GitHub Pages with Jekyll for knowledge base
   - Rationale: Native GitHub integration, simple Markdown-first workflow, free hosting
   - Trade-offs: Less flexibility than custom solution, but much lower maintenance
   - Status: Implemented

2. **Decision**: Organize content by type rather than by topic
   - Rationale: Clearer information architecture, easier to maintain, supports multiple perspectives
   - Trade-offs: May need cross-references, but tags help with topic-based discovery
   - Status: Implemented

3. **Decision**: Use dual licensing (CC BY 4.0 for docs, MIT for code)
   - Rationale: Maximize reuse while being clear about terms for different content types
   - Trade-offs: Slightly more complex than single license, but appropriate for mixed content
   - Status: Planned

## Blockers and Challenges

- Need to establish regular cadence for updating knowledge base (weekly journal entries, reading notes after each paper)
- Should validate local Jekyll build works correctly
- Need to get feedback from team on structure and templates

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. [x] Create basic directory structure
2. [x] Set up Jekyll configuration
3. [x] Create content templates
4. [ ] Add example content
5. [ ] Test local build
6. [ ] Update README with instructions

### Short-term (Next 2-4 Weeks)
- Begin regular reading notes for key papers in perception and planning
- Create first synthesis on state estimation approaches
- Establish workflow for PR reviews and content updates

### Long-term
- Build comprehensive knowledge base on autonomy fundamentals
- Document experimental results and lessons learned
- Establish this as go-to resource for team and broader community

## Notes

The knowledge base structure is intentionally simple and boring - avoiding clever organization schemes or fancy features. The goal is sustainable, long-term maintainability with focus on content quality over presentation.

Templates provide structure but should be adapted as needed. Not every section needs to be filled in every time.
