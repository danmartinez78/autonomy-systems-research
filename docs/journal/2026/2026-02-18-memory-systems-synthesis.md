# Memory Systems for VLA-based Autonomous Robots

Published first research synthesis examining memory architectures for VLA-based robots. Covers MemoryVLA (dual-stream perceptual+cognitive memory), Mind Palace (scene graph world instances), RoboMemory (multi-memory framework), and topological navigation memory.

**Key insight**: Current VLA models operate on single observations — memory systems enable long-horizon tasks, non-Markovian dependencies, and multi-episode understanding.
