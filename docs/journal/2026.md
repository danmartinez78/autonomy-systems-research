## 2026-02-18 — Memory Systems for VLA-based Autonomous Robots

Published first research synthesis examining memory architectures for VLA-based robots. Covers MemoryVLA (dual-stream perceptual+cognitive memory), Mind Palace (scene graph world instances), RoboMemory (multi-memory framework), and topological navigation memory.

[Read the synthesis]({{ "/syntheses/memory-systems-vla-robots/" | relative_url }}) | [PR #21](https://github.com/danmartinez78/autonomy-systems-research/pull/21)

## 2026-02-18 — Initial Setup

Set up the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site with directory structure for reading notes, syntheses, knowledge base, and journal. Created templates for each artifact type. Established CC BY 4.0 (docs) / MIT (code) licensing.

**Decisions**: Organize by type (not topic), minimalist theme, public research artifacts.
