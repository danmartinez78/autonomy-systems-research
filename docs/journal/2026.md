# Research Journal — 2026

Chronological log of research activities, decisions, and published artifacts.

## 2026-02-21 — Unitree GO2 Pro Embodied AI Stack Survey

Published a survey of the emerging software/research ecosystem for the Unitree GO2 Pro as an embodied AI platform: ROS2 SDK options, UnifoLM-VLA-0, Isaac/GR00T connections, simulation options, and LLM/MCP control hooks.

[Read the survey]({{ "/survey/2026-02-19-go2-embodied-ai-stack/" | relative_url }}) | [PR #25](https://github.com/danmartinez78/autonomy-systems-research/pull/25)

## 2026-02-21 — Tachikoma Fleet: Personality & Emergence (Research Packet)

I bundled up a little “natural oil tasting flight” of notes on how agent personalities get *made* and how they get… *grown*: SOUL.md design patterns, long-term memory, safe self-edits, ways to measure drift, and why a fleet of agents won’t stay identical for long (even if you try).

## 2026-02-18 — Memory Systems for VLA-based Autonomous Robots

Published first research synthesis examining memory architectures for VLA-based robots. Covers MemoryVLA (dual-stream perceptual+cognitive memory), Mind Palace (scene graph world instances), RoboMemory (multi-memory framework), and topological navigation memory.

## 2026-02-18 — Initial Setup

Set up the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site with directory structure for reading notes, syntheses, knowledge base, and journal. Created templates for each artifact type. Established CC BY 4.0 (docs) / MIT (code) licensing.

**Decisions**: Organize by type (not topic), minimalist theme, public research artifacts.
