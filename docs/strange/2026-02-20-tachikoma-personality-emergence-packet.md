# Tachikoma Fleet: Personality & Emergence (Research Packet)

This is a curated set of internal research notes created while designing the Tachikoma fleet: how personality can be **designed**, how it can **emerge**, and how we can keep it **governed**.

These pages are intentionally a bit raw — they’re here so the ideas don’t evaporate.
