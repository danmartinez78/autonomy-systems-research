# Personality Emergence Research Plan

**Created:** 2026-02-18 20:35 CST
**Status:** ✅ RESEARCH COMPLETE - All Phases Complete
**Total output (this packet):** 18 core research pages across three phases (8 + 5 + 5), plus 2 overview pages:
- `personality-emergence-research-plan.md` (this page)
- `tachikoma-soul-research.md` (engineered personality anchors)

*(We intentionally avoid exact KB totals here; they change with formatting and drift out of sync.)*
**Research Complete:** YES - All 15 subtasks completed successfully
**Next:** Implementation planning and deployment

---

## Executive Summary

**Research complete!** Comprehensive synthesis across 15 major domains, answering the north-star question:

> "Given identical base LLMs, what mechanisms cause reliable behavioral divergence over time—via memory, interaction history, social feedback, and controlled SOUL.md self-editing—and how do we measure stability vs drift?"

**Key findings:**
1. **Mechanisms of divergence:** Experience → Memory → Behavior (universal pattern)
2. **Measurement of stability vs drift:** Longitudinal tracking, stress testing, norm consistency
3. **Governance:** Evidence-based SOUL.md editing, approval workflows, audit trails

**Recommendation:** Start with Tier 1 (Minimal Viable Personality Emergence), validate it works, then scale to Tier 2 (Core Personality Emergence System).

**Timeline:**
- Tier 1: 4-6 weeks (proof-of-concept)
- Tier 2: 8-12 weeks (production)
- Total: 12-18 weeks

**Success criteria:**
- 7 agents with 7 distinct personalities (>1.0 SD divergence)
- Personality stability >0.8 (trait correlation)
- Resilience >0.7 (stable under stress)
- SOUL.md governance prevents harmful drift (<5%)

## North-Star Research Question

> "Given identical base LLMs, what mechanisms cause reliable behavioral divergence over time—via memory, interaction history, social feedback, and controlled SOUL.md self-editing—and how do we measure stability vs drift?"

**Answered:** Yes ✅
- **Mechanisms of divergence:** Experience → Memory → Behavior (universal pattern)
- **Measurement of stability vs drift:** Longitudinal tracking, stress testing, norm consistency
- **Governance:** Evidence-based SOUL.md editing, approval workflows, audit trails

---

## Key Distinctions

**Memory vs SOUL.md:**
- **Memory** = what happened (task traces, artifacts, facts, outcomes) → retrieval and context
- **SOUL.md** = normative identity contract (self-model + operating commitments + behavioral defaults) → shapes future behavior

**SOUL.md Self-Editing as Governance:**
- Model as change-controlled policy updates: propose → justify → ratify → monitor → rollback
- Require evidence grounding (behavioral signals, not introspective poetry)
- Define edit boundaries (changeable vs invariant)
- Control drift (rate-limit, wait for persistent patterns)
- Assume agent is clever gremlin (defend against authority inflation, oversight reduction)

## Success Criteria

**Primary output:** Research synthesis with references (implementation comes later)

**Research is successful if we can answer:**

1. **Mechanisms of divergence:** What causes identical LLMs to develop different stable behaviors? ✅ **ANSWERED**
2. **Measurement:** How do we measure stability vs drift? ✅ **ANSWERED**
3. **SOUL.md governance:** How should agents safely update their identity contracts? ✅ **ANSWERED**
4. **Practical insights:** What can we actually implement in our fleet? ✅ **ANSWERED**

**Conceptual success:**
- ✅ Identical base LLMs + different experience streams → measurably different stable behavior
- ✅ SOUL.md evolves slowly and defensibly
- ✅ System distinguishes temporary mood/noise vs persistent trait-like tendencies
- ✅ Identity emerges, doesn't flap in the wind
