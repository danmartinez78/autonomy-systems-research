# Autonomy Systems Research

Welcome to the Autonomy Systems Research knowledge base. This site is a structured collection of research artifacts, reading notes, syntheses, and evergreen knowledge for robotics and autonomy systems.

## Purpose

This knowledge base serves as a public repository for:
- **Reading Notes**: Summaries and critical analysis of papers, articles, and technical reports
- **Journal Entries**: Dated progress logs tracking research activities and decisions
- **Syntheses**: Topic-level living documents that consolidate understanding across multiple sources
- **Knowledge Base**: Evergreen pages on concepts, patterns, checklists, and practical considerations
- **References**: Glossary, definitions, and canonical links

## Organization

The content is organized into several sections, accessible via the navigation menu:

- **[Journal](/journal.html)**: Chronological entries documenting research progress
- **[Reading Notes](/reading.html)**: Structured notes on papers and articles
- **[Syntheses](/syntheses.html)**: Consolidated understanding of research topics
- **[Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base.html)**: Evergreen reference material
- **[References](/references.html)**: Glossary and canonical links

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/danmartinez78/autonomy-systems-research/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to add content.
