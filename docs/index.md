# Autonomy Systems Research

Welcome to the Autonomy Systems Research knowledge base. This site is a structured collection of research artifacts, reading notes, syntheses, and evergreen knowledge for robotics and autonomy systems.

## Purpose

This knowledge base serves as a public repository for:
- **Reading Notes**: Summaries and critical analysis of papers, articles, and technical reports
- **Journal Entries**: Dated progress logs tracking research activities and decisions
- **Syntheses**: Topic-level living documents that consolidate understanding across multiple sources
- **Knowledge Base**: Evergreen pages on concepts, patterns, checklists, and practical considerations
- **References**: Glossary, definitions, and canonical links

## Organization

The content is organized into several sections, accessible via the navigation menu:

- **[Journal]({{ "/journal/" | relative_url }})**: Chronological entries documenting research progress
- **[Reading Notes]({{ "/reading/" | relative_url }})**: Structured notes on papers and articles
- **[Syntheses]({{ "/syntheses/" | relative_url }})**: Consolidated understanding of research topics
- **[Knowledge Base]({{ "/knowledge-base/" | relative_url }})**: Evergreen reference material
- **[References]({{ "/references/" | relative_url }})**: Glossary and canonical links
- **[Tags]({{ "/tags/" | relative_url }})**: Browse content by topic tags
- **[Search]({{ "/search/" | relative_url }})**: Full-text search across all content
